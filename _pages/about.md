Hi! I am Yiming Chen. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), specializing in Machine Learning. I am a member of the Hays Lab, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. James Hays](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, with a focus on 3D scene understanding, generative modeling, and physical scene properties.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I have also had valuable research collaborations with Google DeepMind and NVIDIA, and gained industry experience as an intern at Amazon Web Services.

If you'd like to discuss research opportunities, please feel free to reach out via email.
