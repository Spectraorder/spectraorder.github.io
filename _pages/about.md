I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Mathematics from New York University. My research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, with hands-on experience in image generation and 3D generation models. I am passionate about advancing generative modeling capabilities and exploring how these technologies can be applied to create more sophisticated AI systems. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of world models, and I believe that physics prediction and video prediction models represent crucial stepping stones toward achieving this vision.
