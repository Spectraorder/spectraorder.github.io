The **CSG-Based ML-Supported 3D Translation** paper addresses the significant challenge of translating hand-drawn 2D sketches into complex 3D models efficiently. Leveraging the precision of Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) and machine learning advancements, the research presents a system that automates this transformation, providing real-time visualization and enabling intuitive design workflows.

Key features of this research include:
- Utilizing CSG to combine basic geometric shapes into detailed 3D structures.
- Developing machine learning methods for accurate sketch recognition and vertex analysis.
- Introducing a user-friendly web interface for live 3D sketch rendering.

Applications of this system span architecture, game design, and prototyping, offering a 40% improvement in modeling automation and a 20% reduction in texture rendering time. The system democratizes access to advanced 3D modeling tools, fostering creativity and enhancing productivity.
