## Overview
The research focused on developing algorithms that leverage **Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)** to translate hand-drawn sketches into 3D game assets. By automating the sketch-to-model conversion process, this project aimed to improve prototyping workflows for game designers.

## Methodology
1. **Algorithm Development**: Designed a CSG-based approach to interpret hand-drawn sketches and convert them into 3D models.
2. **Diffusion Model Optimization**: Enhanced texture rendering by implementing refinement techniques, reducing rendering time by **20%**.
3. **Real-Time Visualization**: Built a full-stack application using **Three.js** and **WebGL** to provide a seamless, real-time drawing and visualization experience.

## Results
- Improved automation in sketch-to-model translation by **40%**.
- Reduced texture rendering time by **20%**.
- Received positive feedback from game designers who reported significant improvements in efficiency during early-stage prototyping.

## Impact
This research has the potential to revolutionize early-stage game design workflows by making 3D modeling more accessible and efficient. By automating the translation process, designers can focus on creativity rather than technical challenges, accelerating development cycles and reducing costs.
