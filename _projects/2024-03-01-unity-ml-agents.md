The **Unity ML-Agents with Walking Robot** project focused on developing an AI-powered walking robot capable of navigating complex environments with improved efficiency and balance. Utilizing Unity's ML-Agents toolkit, this project employed curriculum training to progressively enhance the agent's walking and obstacle-avoidance capabilities.

Key innovations included implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for phased training, which significantly improved the robotâ€™s navigation and balance. Ray perception techniques were added to enhance obstacle detection, leading to better avoidance strategies.

### Highlights
- **Enhanced Training Efficiency**: Developed a phased curriculum training approach that boosted navigation, balance, and obstacle avoidance efficiency by **35%**.
- **Improved Obstacle Detection**: Integrated ray perception for enhanced obstacle detection, increasing efficiency by **40%**.
- **Optimized Performance**: Optimized neural network architectures and hyperparameters, achieving a **25% reduction in training time** and faster convergence.

This project demonstrated how curriculum training and efficient ML model optimization could be leveraged to address real-world challenges in robotics. Its results highlight the potential for scalable solutions in navigation and robotics applications, particularly in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments.
